If the patient suffering from SZ is not diagnosed and treated in the early stages, damage to human behavioral abilities in its later stages could become more severe. Therefore, early discovery of SZ may help to cure or limit the effects. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is prominently used to study brain diseases such as SZ due to having high temporal resolution information, and being a noninvasive and inexpensive method...",
